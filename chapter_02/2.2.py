    # train_images is an array containing multiple images. Each image in this array is itself a 2D array of pixel values.
    # The variable digit now holds the data for this fifth image.
    # Matplotlib is a library for creating visualizations, including plotting images.
    # plt.imshow is a function that displays data as an image. Here, it's used to display the contents of digit.
    # digit is the 2D array of pixel values representing the image.
    # cmap=plt.cm.binary specifies the color map to use.
    # The 'binary' colormap displays the image in grayscale, interpreting the array values as intensities (0 being black, 255 being white for 8-bit grayscale images).

# Manipulating tensors in Numpy
    # In the previous example, we chose a specific digit alongside the first axis using the syntax train_images[i].
    # This is called tensor slicing
    # E.g: Selects digits #10 to #100 (#100 not included) and puts them in an array of shape (90, 28, 28):
my_slice = train_images[10:100]
print(my_slice.shape)
    # When you slice a portion of a multidimentional array, it retains the original dimensions of the array.
    # It's equivalent to this more detailed notation, which specifies a start index and stop index for the slice along each tensor axis.
my_slice = train_images[10:100, :, :]
my_slice = train_images[10:100, 0:28, 0:28]
    # Deep learning model don;t process an entire dataset at once; they break them into small batches;
        # batch = train_images[:128]
    # Next batch
        # batch = train_images[128:256]
