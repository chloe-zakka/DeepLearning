# Description

This repository is part of my personal journey through the "Deep Learning with Python" book by Fran√ßois Chollet. As I work my way through the book, I'll be posting my code, exercises, and projects chapter by chapter. My goal is to understand and apply deep learning concepts by implementing them in code using the Keras library, as taught in the book.

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a chapter in the book, containing Python scripts that reflect my implementations of the concepts discussed. Alongside the code, I might also include my notes and comments to clarify my thought process and document any challenges I faced and how I overcame them.

Please note that this repository is solely for educational purposes and to track my progress in learning deep learning principles. It's a live document of my learning experience and will be updated regularly as I advance through the book's material.

# How to Navigate This Repository:

* The repository is structured by chapters, with each chapter's learning encapsulated in its own directory.
* The master branch holds the latest, most stable version of my study progress.
* For each chapter, you'll find a README file that summarizes the key learning points and any particular focus areas of my coding practice.
