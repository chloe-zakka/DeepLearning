# DeepLearning
This repository is part of my personal journey through the "Deep Learning with Python" book by Fran√ßois Chollet. As I work my way through the book, I'll be posting my code, exercises, and projects chapter by chapter. My goal is to understand and apply deep learning concepts by implementing them in code, as taught in the book.
